### Chapter 7: Hypothesis Testing

#### 7.1 Introduction
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data. It provides a formal framework for testing claims about populations using evidence from samples.

#### 7.2 Components of Hypothesis Testing

**The Null Hypothesis (H₀)**
The null hypothesis represents the status quo or the claim to be tested. It is a statement of no effect or no difference. The null hypothesis is assumed to be true until evidence suggests otherwise.

**The Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)**
The alternative hypothesis represents what we are trying to prove. It is the opposite of the null hypothesis and represents a new claim about the population parameter.

#### 7.3 The Five-Step Process

1. **State the Hypotheses**: Formulate H₀ and H₁ based on the research question
2. **Set the Significance Level (α)**: Commonly set at 0.05 or 0.01
3. **Calculate the Test Statistic**: Use appropriate formula based on the type of test
4. **Determine the P-Value**: Calculate the probability of obtaining the observed results
5. **Make a Decision**: Compare p-value to α and reject or fail to reject H₀

#### 7.4 Types of Errors

In hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur:

**Type I Error**
A Type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by α (alpha), which is the significance level of the test.

**Type II Error**
A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by β (beta).

**Statistical Power**
The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, calculated as 1 - β.

#### 7.5 One-Tailed vs Two-Tailed Tests

Tests can be one-tailed (directional) or two-tailed (non-directional), depending on the nature of the alternative hypothesis. The choice affects the critical values and the interpretation of results.

#### 7.6 Common Test Statistics

Different test statistics are used depending on the situation:
- Z-test: When population standard deviation is known
- t-test: When population standard deviation is unknown
- Chi-square test: For categorical data
- F-test: For comparing variances

#### 7.7 Interpreting Results

When p-value < α: Reject the null hypothesis. There is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

When p-value ≥ α: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

Note: Failing to reject H₀ does not mean H₀ is proven true; it means there is not enough evidence to conclude it is false.

### Hypothesis Testing: The Art of Statistical Skepticism
*Or: How to Scientifically Prove Your Roommate Is Actually Stealing Your Food*

Welcome to hypothesis testing, where we get to play detective, jury, and that annoying friend who needs proof for everything. It's like being in a relationship where statistics keeps asking, "But can you PROVE you didn't eat the last cookie?"

#### The Setup: Meeting Our Hypotheses

**The Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The "nothing to see here" hypothesis
- This is your statistical equivalent of "I'm fine" (narrator: they were not fine)
- It assumes everything is normal, boring, and exactly as expected
- Like assuming your roommate ISN'T eating your food (sweet, naive H₀)

**The Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The "something's fishy" hypothesis  
- Your suspicion that something interesting is happening
- The statistical "I KNEW IT!"
- What you're secretly hoping is true (yes, Brad IS stealing your yogurt)

#### The Process: CSI Statistics

**Step 1: State Your Hypotheses**
- H₀: "Brad is NOT eating my food" (benefit of the doubt)
- H₁: "Brad is TOTALLY eating my food" (the accusation)

**Step 2: Choose Your Significance Level (α)**
- Usually 0.05, because statisticians agreed 5% doubt is reasonable
- It's like saying, "I'm 95% sure before I accuse Brad"
- Think of it as your "statistical courage level"

**Step 3: Gather Evidence (Calculate Test Statistic)**
- Count missing yogurts, measure sandwich lengths, document cookie depreciation
- This is where you go full detective mode with spreadsheets

**Step 4: The P-Value (Probability of Innocence)**
- How likely is this evidence if Brad really IS innocent?
- P < 0.05: "Brad, we need to talk..."
- P > 0.05: "Sorry Brad, my bad" (but you're still suspicious)

**Step 5: The Verdict**
- Reject H₀: "GUILTY! I mean... statistically significant!"
- Fail to reject H₀: "Not guilty... but I'm watching you, Brad"

#### The Plot Twists: Type I and Type II Errors

**Type I Error: The False Accusation**
- You accuse innocent Brad (rejected true H₀)
- The statistical equivalent of wrongful conviction
- Brad moves out, you later find the dog ate your food
- Probability = α (that 5% we talked about)
- *Memorable as:* "Type ONE = Wrongfully accuse someONE"

**Type II Error: The Missed Criminal**
- Brad's guilty but you let him go (failed to reject false H₀)
- He continues his yogurt crime spree
- You keep wondering why food disappears
- Probability = β (beta, because it's the "B-side" error)
- *Memorable as:* "Type TWO = TOO trusting"

#### The Power Move
**Statistical Power (1 - β):** Your ability to catch Brad when he's actually guilty
- Like having security cameras in the fridge
- Higher power = better Brad-detection system
- Increase power by: more evidence, bigger effect, or lowering your standards

#### Real-World Translation
Instead of food theft, imagine:
- Medical trials: "Does this drug work?" (Lives at stake, not yogurt)
- Quality control: "Are these chips actually 500g?" (Corporate Brad)
- A/B testing: "Does this button color increase clicks?" (Digital Brad)

#### The Statistical Life Lesson
Hypothesis testing teaches us that:
1. We can never be 100% certain (sorry, perfectionists)
2. We're basically pessimists (assuming nothing works until proven otherwise)
3. It's better to let guilty Brad go than convict innocent Brad (usually)
4. Statistics has trust issues, and that's actually good

#### Remember This Forever
"Hypothesis testing is just statistics asking 'Prove it!' to everything, like that one skeptical friend who needs receipts for every story you tell."

## Professor Performance Notes

### Delivery Tips:
1. **Brad Introduction**: Pick a common name from your university. Make it personal.
2. **Timing**: Pause after "narrator: they were not fine" for effect
3. **Props**: Bring a yogurt container as visual aid
4. **Interaction**: Ask students "Who's been Brad?" and "Who's had a Brad?"

### Backup Jokes:
- If food theft doesn't land: Use "parking spot theft" or "Netflix password sharing"
- Alternative to Brad: Use "your roommate" or "that person in your group project"

### Visual Gags for Slides:
1. Courtroom scene with H₀ in defendant chair
2. Detective with magnifying glass examining p-value
3. Type I and II errors as "Oops" memes
4. Power represented as superhero strength meter

### Timing:
- Full segment: 12-15 minutes
- Allow for laughter: 30 seconds after major jokes
- Interactive moments: 2-3 minutes total

## Student Worksheet: "Hypothesis Testing: Prove It!"

### Practice Problem: The Great Coffee Shop Conspiracy
You suspect your local coffee shop isn't actually putting extra shots in your "double shot" latte.

1. Write H₀ and H₁ in both statistical and "real talk" language
2. If α = 0.05, explain to your non-stats friend what this means
3. You test 20 "double shots" and find evidence. If p = 0.03, what do you tell the barista?
4. Describe a Type I error in this scenario. How angry would you be?
5. Describe a Type II error. What are you missing out on?
6. BONUS: Write a Yelp review using only statistical terms

### The Statistical Pickup Line Challenge
Create a pickup line using one of these terms:
- Null hypothesis
- Significance level  
- P-value
- Statistical power

Winner gets... statistically significant bragging rights!
