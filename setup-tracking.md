# Setting Up Email Click Tracking

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Option 1: GoatCounter (Recommended - Free & Privacy-Friendly)
1. Go to https://goatcounter.com
2. Sign up for free account
3. Add their script to your pages
4. You'll see every visit with referrer codes

### Option 2: Simple URL Shortener with Stats
1. Use bit.ly or tinyurl.com
2. Create unique short links for each email
3. Check stats to see clicks

### Option 3: DIY Tracking with GitHub Pages

For each Craigslist response, create a unique link:
```
https://light-merlin-dark.github.io/public/resume?ref=statistics-prof-jan6
https://light-merlin-dark.github.io/public/resume?ref=azure-migration-jan6
https://light-merlin-dark.github.io/public/resume?ref=quantum-code-jan6
```

## How to Use in Your Emails

Instead of sending:
```
Check out my resume: https://docs.google.com/...
```

Send:
```
Check out my resume: https://light-merlin-dark.github.io/public/resume?ref=uniquecode
```

## What This Tells You

1. **They clicked = They're interested enough to learn more**
2. **No click after 48 hours = They probably didn't read it**
3. **Multiple clicks = Strong interest**

## Verification Strategy

In your email, mention:
```
"You can verify I'm genuine - my email pixelbobby@gmail.com is listed on my 
GitHub profile at the link above. Feel free to email me directly there if you 
prefer to bypass Craigslist's relay."
```

This:
- Proves you're real (GitHub account = credibility)
- Gives them a direct contact option
- Shows transparency
- Lets you track if they visited

## The Psychology

People who click through to read more are:
- Actually interested
- Taking time to evaluate you
- Worth following up with

People who don't click:
- Might not have read the email
- Weren't interested
- Not worth more energy

This data helps you focus effort where it matters.
