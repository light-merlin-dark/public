## METHODOLOGY & APPROACH

**Tight Feedback Loops Philosophy**

AI has enabled systems to be built more swiftly, but the real breakthrough is creating tight feedback loops that are self-confirming and highly optimized. The key is building solutions that don't create more burden on the system than what they're worth.

This approach drives everything:
- **Speed with Quality**: Rapid iteration with immediate validation
- **Business Impact Focus**: Every line of code tied to measurable outcomes
- **Security First**: Built-in protections, not afterthoughts
- **Question Complexity**: Illuminate simplicity through continuous refinement

Tight feedback loops create minimal overhead while maximizing value delivery.
